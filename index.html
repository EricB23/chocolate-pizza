          For the fig-swirl: Melt butter over medium heat in a saucepan. Add
          brown sugar and stir to dissolve. Halve all of the figs and toss in
          the saucepan with water and lemon juice. Cook over medium heat,
          stirring frequently, until you have a chunky-jammy mixture. Add salt
          with one or two stirs, set aside and let cool completely.

          Using an ice cream machine, pour liquids into the frozen basin and
          process according to manufacturer instructions, i.e.,let spin and
          thicken for 20 minutes before adding mascarpone, fig jam mixture, and
          the nuts. Continue to process for +/- 10 minutes. Pour semi-frozen
          mixture into a pyrex dish or glass tupperware. Freeze for at least two
          hours before serving.
